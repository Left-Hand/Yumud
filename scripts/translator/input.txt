    Defines the reference step value LSBs with each clock input. 
    With clock input mode, the reference moves forward 4*NSTEP 
    LSBs with each clock input. Therefore, the steps number per 
    round is 65536/(4*NSTEP).
    With the digital and PWM input in speed mode, the gain 
    coefficient is 1 when setting NSTEP[0] with 0. The gain 
    coefficient is 8 when setting NSETEP[0] with 1.
